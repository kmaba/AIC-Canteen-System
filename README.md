# AIC Canteen Order System.

Making Canteen Orders for Teachers Easier

## Intent

This project is a project given by my school teachers to make their canteen orders easier.

If you are starting a flutter project of your own here are some resources to consider:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Potential Struggles

I need to develop an app which has:
[] Secure System
[] Only allow teachers under the organization @aic.wa.edu.au
[] Blacklist all students by not allowing student ID numbers (XXXXX@aic.wa.edu.au)
[] Make a Server to display orders, with function such as deny, accept, order fullfilled, and 'On my way'
